##  1. What is an Institutional Review Board?

- An Institutional Review Board (IRB) is an independent body established to protect the rights and welfare of human research participants.
- Under Title 45 Part 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations (45 CFR 46), any research that is federally funded must be reviewed and approved by an IRB.
- The IRB has the authority to:
 Approve, disapprove, or terminate all research activities that fall within its local jurisdiction according to relevant federal regulations and institutional policy.

## 2. Purpose of an IRB?

- The purpose of an IRB is to safeguard the rights, safety, and wellâ€“being of all human research participants.
- Confirming that the research plans do not expose participants to unreasonable risks.
- Reviewing and approving proposed payments or other compensation to study participants.
- Ensuring that human participant protections remain in force throughout the research.
- The IRB may suspend or terminate ongoing research that:
            Is not being conducted in accordance with IRB requirements, or
            Is associated with unexpected or serious harm to participants.

## 3.  Membership of an IRB

- An IRB must have at least five members.
- An IRB must have a diverse membership that includes both scientists and non-scientists. 
= Scientific members may include researchers, physicians, psychologists, nurses, and other mental health professionals.
= Non-scientific members of an IRB may have special knowledge of a certain population (pregnant women, children, or prisoners).

## 4. Responsibilities of an IRB

- Provision of an Infrastructure to Support the Ethical Review of Proposed and Ongoing Research
- Reviewing and Understanding the Full Plan of Study
- Keeping a Written Record of IRB Decisions
- Considering the Investigator's Qualifications
- Conducting Continuing Review of Ongoing Studies
- Requesting More Information When Necessary
- Reviewing Incentives for Participation

## 5. Criteria for IRB Approval of Research

- Beneficence - This criterion relates to the principle of beneficence in the Belmont Report.
- Risks to Participants are Reasonable in Relation to Anticipated Benefits
- Criteria: Risks to Participants are Minimized
The IRB should ensure that procedures used in the proposed research are consistent with sound research design, that they do not expose participants to risk unnecessarily, and, when appropriate, involve diagnostic or treatment procedures that pose no further risk
- Criteria: Selection of Participants is Equitable
- Criteria: Informed Consent is Properly Obtained and Documented
- Criteria: Adequate Provision is Made to Protect Participants' Privacy and Maintain the Confidentiality of Data
- Criteria: Additional Safeguards are Included for Vulnerable Populations

## Expedited Review

-An IRB may use an expedited review procedure for research that:

Involves no more than minimal risk and
Falls into a category that appears on an approved list of categories of research eligible for expedited review.

- The following are examples of research that may be eligible for expedited review:

Collection of hair or baby teeth.
Collection of external secretions, including sweat and saliva.
Recording of data from adults using noninvasive procedures that are routinely employed in clinical practice (not including exposure to electromagnetic radiation outside the visible range, for example, x-rays or microwaves.)
Collection of blood samples by venipuncture.
Voice recordings made for research purposes, such as investigations of speech defects.
Moderate exercise by healthy volunteers.
Study of existing data, documents, records, pathological specimens, or diagnostic specimens.

## Investigators' Responsibilities to the IRB

- Ensure that the IRB receives all the documents it requires to review the proposed research.
- Admit no participant to a study before the IRB has issued its written approval of the study.
- Make no changes to or deviations from the study protocol without prior written approval from the IRB, except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to participants.

- ## IRBs and Multi-Site Research

- Multi-site trials funded by NIH are characterized by the involvement of multiple institutions and study sites engaged in a single research study
- When a research study involves more than one institution, each institution is responsible for safeguarding the rights and well-being of research participants at that institution.

- ## Summary of Key Points

- The purpose of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) is to safeguard the rights, safety, and well-being of all human research participants.
- Any federally funded research involving human participants must be reviewed and approved by an IRB.
- Any clinical investigation involving a product regulated by the FDA must be reviewed and approved by an IRB.
- An IRB has the authority to approve or disapprove all research activities that fall within its jurisdiction.
- It may disapprove a research project with a request for modification. It also has the authority to suspend a research study that it previously approved.
- All previously approved ongoing research must be reviewed by an IRB at least once a year to determine whether approval should be continued.
- Every institution, including in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network (CTN), that participates in a clinical study must identify all IRBs that have jurisdiction to 
  review and approve the protocol.
- To approve a research protocol, the IRB must ensure that:
                  Risks to participants are minimized.
                  Risks to participants are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
                  Selection of participants is equitable.
                  Informed consent is properly obtained and documented.
                  Adequate provision is made for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of participants.
                  Adequate provision is made to protect participants and maintain confidentiality of data.
                  Additional safeguards are included for vulnerable populations.
