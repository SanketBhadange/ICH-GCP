## Part 1: What is Informed Consent?
-  Informed consent is a process by which a person voluntarily agrees to participate in a research study after being fully informed about it
-  informed consent is first and foremost a continuing process. This includes a person voluntarily agreeing to participate in a research study after being fully 
   informed about it via verbal discussion with study staff, followed by documentation in a written, signed, and dated informed consent form.

- The informed consent document should contain all of the information that the person needs to make an informed decision about taking part in the study. Many research teams use the consent document to guide the verbal explanation of the study to potential participants.

## Part 3: Special Requirements Concerning Consent

-Both the informed consent discussion and the written informed consent form and any other written information to be provided to participants should include explanations of the following:

That the trial involves research.
The purpose of the trial.
The trial treatment(s) and the probability for random assignment to each treatment.
The trial procedures to be followed, including all invasive procedures.
The participant’s responsibilities.
Those aspects of the trial that are experimental.
The reasonably foreseeable risks or inconveniences to the participant and, when applicable, to an embryo, fetus, or nursing infant.
The reasonably expected benefits. When there is no intended clinical benefit to the participant, the participant should be made aware of this.
The alternative procedure(s) or course(s) of treatment that may be available to the participant, and their important potential benefits and risks.
The compensation and/or treatment available to the participant in the event of trial-related injury.
The anticipated prorated payment, if any, to the participant for participating in the trial.
The anticipated expenses, if any, to the participant for participating in the trial.
That the participant’s participation in the trial is voluntary and that the participant may refuse to participate or withdraw from the trial, at any time, without penalty or loss of benefits to which the participant is otherwise entitled.
That the monitor(s), the auditor(s), the IRB, and the regulatory authorities will be granted direct access to the participant’s original medical records for verification of clinical trial procedures and/or data, without violating the confidentiality of the participant, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws and regulations and that, by signing a written informed consent form, the participant or the participant’s legally acceptable representative is authorizing such access.
That records identifying the participant will be kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws and/or regulations, will not be made publicly available. If the results of the trial are published, the participant’s identity will remain confidential.
That the participant or the participant’s legally acceptable representative will be informed in a timely manner if information becomes available that may be relevant to the participant’s willingness to continue participation in the trial.
The person(s) to contact for further information regarding the trial and the rights of trial participants, and whom to contact in the event of trial-related injury.
The foreseeable circumstances and/or reasons under which the participant’s participation in the trial may be terminated.
The expected duration of the participant’s participation in the trial.
The approximate number of participants involved in the trial.

### Special Requirements Concerning the Consent of Pregnant Women

When a research activity involves pregnant women as participants:

Both mother and father must be informed about any potential impact of the research on the fetus.
Both mother and father must consent to the woman’s participation in the research. However, the father’s consent is not required in the following circumstances:
The purpose of the research is to meet the health needs of the mother.
The father’s identity or whereabouts cannot be determined.
The father is not reasonably available.
The pregnancy resulted from rape.

### Special Requirements Concerning the Consent of Children

- When children or minors are involved in research, both the assent of the child or minor and the permission of his or her parent(s) are usually required.
- Permission means the agreement of parent(s) or a legal guardian to the participation of their child or ward in research.
- Assent means a child’s agreement to participate in research. Failure to object is not assent.

### Special Requirements Concerning the Consent of Prisoners

-The IRB must approve the study as prisoner research.
The IRB that reviews and approves the study must include a prisoner or prisoner advocate in its membership.

## Part 4: The Informed Consent Process

To be valid, informed consent must be based on the following:

### Capacity to Give Informed Consent

- Before the informed consent process can begin, the potential participant must be deemed capable of understanding his or her actions and making a reasoned decision

### Disclosure of all Relevant Information

- The research team must disclose all relevant information about the study to the potential participant.
- This information generally includes:

The purpose of the study.
The nature of the procedure or intervention that is being studied.
Reasonable alternatives to participation in the study.
The potential risks and benefits as well as the uncertainties of study participation.
The participants obligations for the duration of the study.

### Comprehension by the Participant

The potential participant must understand the information disclosed to him or her about the research study. The participant is free to ask questions to the study team as well as take additional time to make a decision regarding participation. The research team must be able to evaluate the potential participant’s ability to understand what his or her participation in the study would involve. The informed consent document might include a quiz or other documented assessment to assess whether the participant truly understands the study.
### Voluntary Agreement by the Participant

= The participant must agree to participate in the research study and his or her agreement must be voluntary and free from coercion or undue influence.

### Right to Withdraw

- The participant must be informed that he or she has a right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, without penalty or loss of benefits that he or she would otherwise be entitled to receive.

## Part 5: Inviting Potential Participants to Enroll in a Research Study

- Written documentation of Institutional Review Board approval of the study, consent document(s) and recruitment materials (where appropriate) must be obtained 
  and provided to the sponsor

- Members of the research team may find it helpful to keep the following questions in mind as they go through the process of recruiting participants for a study:
- Is the participant capable of understanding information about the study and giving informed consent voluntarily?
- Has the participant been given sufficient, accurate information about the study?
- Does the participant understand the information he or she has been given about the study?
- Is the participant’s decision to participate in the study entirely voluntary or has he or she been coerced or influenced in any way (e.g., by circumstances or 
  by other people)?
- Does the participant understand that signing the informed consent document indicates agreement to participate in the study?

## Part 6: Quality Control in the Informed Consent Process

- Protection of human research participants is the primary goal of the IRB and the informed consent process.
- f violations of the informed consent process are severe or continuing, penalties may be imposed and the IRB may report the problem to the regulatory 
  authorities. It is therefore important to ensure that the process of obtaining informed consent from participants is carried out carefully and with due 
  attention to every detail
- Remember, mistakes will happen. The most important thing to remember is to deal with them openly and honestly and report them immediately upon identification. 
  The study staff will help you identify methods to prevent them from happening again.

The following are examples of some of the most common errors that can occur in the informed consent process.

1. The Participant Signs the Informed Consent Form After Study Procedures Have Begun
- Corrective Action: Review the study and the consent form with the participant as soon as the failure is identified. Document all steps to correct the situation, attach them to the signed Informed Consent Form and notify your supervisor as soon as possible.

2. The Consent Form is Signed by the Participant But is Missing the Initials or Signature of the Investigator or Witness (if Applicable), or is Not Dated
- Conduct consent interviews in a quiet, separate room.
When reviewing a consent form with a participant, focus on that task. Don’t answer the phone or respond to distractions unless there is a genuine emergency.
The person obtaining the participant’s consent must be present when the consent form is signed. Having the investigator sign the consent form later is unacceptable. Never backdate a consent form.
Create and use a checklist to ensure that every detail in the informed consent process is completed.

3. Whiteout is Used to Correct an Error on the Consent Form
- How can this error be prevented?
By following good documentation practices. If an error occurs while the consent form is being completed, use Good Clinical Practice or Good Medical Record correction techniques to correct it: Cross out the error without obscuring the original entry, initial and date the crossing-out, and enter the correct information. (See also Good Medical Record practices to observe when writing progress notes in the Documentation and Record-Keeping module.)

4.An Out-of-Date Version of the Consent Form is Used
-Corrective Action: When the issue is identified reconsent the participant using the appropriate Informed Consent Form. Attach a memo identifying the issue and the corrective action to the new consent form.

5.A New Consent Form is Required, But Not All Participants Signed It
- Corrective Action: When the issue is identified have the participant review, sign and date the new consent form. Document the reason for the delay and attach it to the new consent form.

6. The Original Consent Form Has Been Lost
- Corrective Action: Report the loss of a consent form immediately to the IRB and/or the sponsor and get another signed as soon as possible. To avoid the appearance of fraud, carefully document the sequence of events that led to the loss of the first consent form.

## Part 7: Requirements for the Documentation of Informed Consent 

### Informed Consent Shall be Documented by the Use of a Written Consent Form
- The IRB must approve the consent form.
- The participant or the participant’s legally authorized representative must sign the current version of the IRB approved consent form.
- ICH GCP requires that the consent form should also be signed by the person conducting the informed consent discussion.
- A copy of the form must be given to the person who signs it. The study site must keep the original on file.

### The Consent Form May Take One of Two Organizational Structures
A short-form written document stating that the elements of informed consent were presented orally to the participant or the participant’s representative. When the short form document is used:
A witness must be present at the oral presentation.
The IRB must approve a written summary of what is to be said to the participant or representative.
The participant or representative must sign only the short form itself.
The witness must sign both the short form and a copy of the summary.
The person obtaining the participant’s consent must also sign a copy of the summary.

### Researchers Must Not Waive or Appear to Waive Any Legal Rights of Participants

### The Consent Form Must be Revised When New Information Becomes Available that May Be Relevant to the Participant’s Consent
If a new adverse event appears to be related to the study medication (e.g., a severe allergic reaction that occurs shortly after a medication is given), this risk should be added to a revised consent form.

The revised consent form must be approved by the IRB.
The participant must be informed of the new information in a timely manner.
The communication of the new information to the participant must be documented.

## Part 9: Summary of Key Points

Informed consent is a process by which a person voluntarily agrees to participate in a research study after being fully informed about it.
The informed consent document should contain all of the information that the participant needs to make an informed decision about participating in the study.
The participant’s signature on the informed consent document confirms his or her voluntary agreement to take part in the study.
The general requirements for informed consent in federally funded research are spelled out in 45 CFR 46.116 and 21 CFR 50.20. Some states have enacted requirements for informed consent that go beyond federal regulations.
All researchers have a responsibility to ensure that the process of obtaining informed consent or assent from study participants not only conforms to federal, state, and local regulations but also respects each individual’s right to make an informed decision voluntarily.
The first step in the process of informed consent is preparing the consent document and supporting documents for presentation to the Institutional Review Board that must review and approve the study and consent document. The IRB must review and approve the consent document before the study can begin.
Consent documents should be written in nontechnical language that the proposed participants would understand. The language should be consistent with the proposed participants’ educational level, cultural views, and familiarity with research.
The information that must be provided in an informed consent document is specified in 45 CFR 46.116, 21 CFR 50.20, and ICH GCP 4.8.10.
The legal age for consent in most states is 18; persons under age 18 are considered minors. Additional protections for children involved as participants in research are set forth in 45 CFR 46 Subpart D. In most cases, both parents must provide permission and the child himself or herself must assent to the child’s participation in research.
If a person is unable to provide informed consent, a legal representative may give permission for the individual to participate in research in some circumstances. Only one person gives consent. If the participant is capable and is not court ordered legally incompetent, then he or she should sign. If the participant is not capable or is legally incompetent, then the legal representative or guardian should sign. A child and the parents sign, but minor children assent, parents provide permission, and legal guardians consent.
Participants must not be coerced or unduly influenced. Coercion occurs if an individual perceives that he or she could be harmed or punished for refusing to take part in a study. In some cases, coercion may occur subtly and unintentionally.
The value of an incentive for participation in a study should not be so high that it could be considered an undue influence on an individual’s decision to participate.
It is important to ensure that the process of obtaining informed consent from human participants is carried out carefully and with vigilant attention to every detail. Failure to comply with general requirements for informed consent (45 CFR 46.116) and documentation of informed consent (45 CFR 46.117) may result in suspension of a study as well as fines and penalties.
